![Coder Arena](/images/2020/05/coderarena-header.png)

__Coder Arena__ is a teaching initiative founded in 2020.

Like many in the software development market, I started studying programming at a very young age, around 12 years old.

At the beginning of my studies everything was very new, all the content found was absurdly exciting, I continued studying in search of new skills, after all **development is not just about code**.

A few years later, I had already acquired a lot of free and paid knowledge, video lessons, articles, books, podcasts and whatever else was within my reach.

I developed several projects, from the simplest to some more complex, and it was at that very moment that I realized that I needed something more.

I entered the job market and **had the opportunity to work on various projects, each with its own particularity.**

It was incredible, I learned a lot during this period and I met sensational people who collaborated with my career at different levels.

Some time later, I decided that I would help those who were once in the same situation as me, needing more advanced knowledge, focused on what the market really seeks.

Something that could actually make them more prepared for the market, and who knows, for the development of their own businesses.

__It was then that Coder Arena was born.__

## The Founder

I am passionate about coffee, technology, programming and entrepreneurship.

I am not a training educator, but I love to share knowledge and help those I can. I am always open for a good chat.

My last professional experience was at the [**Brazilian Startup Association**](https://abstartups.com.br/), where I worked as responsible for the Technology and Product area. The institution's main product is [StartupBase](https://sbase.me), the largest database of startups in Brazil.

Currently I work at [**Juntos Somos Mais**](https://www.juntossomosmais.com.br/), a company that was born to strengthen the construction retail and transform the lives of professionals who build dreams.

**Juntos Somos Mais** is the **largest loyalty program in the retail trade of construction material**, bringing qualifications and benefits to tenants, salespeople and construction professionals.
